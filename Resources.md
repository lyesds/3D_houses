Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) are three commonly implemented geospatial features generated with UAV mapping systems. Each data product delivers different elevation values as each model uses different methodologies. Elevation values from a LiDAR point cloud come from features including bare-ground, power lines, tree canopies or buildings. Selecting the right elevation model for your project can be challenging that is why Geodetics offers the following three simplified, but common interpretations for these data products:

– A DEM (Digital Elevation Model) Represents the bare-Earth surface, removing all natural and built features;  
– A DSM (Digital Surface Model) captures both the natural and built/artificial features of the environment, as shown below;  
– A DTM (Digital Terrain Model)  typically augments a DEM, by including vector features of the natural terrain, such as rivers and ridges. A DTM may be interpolated to generate a DEM, but not vice versa.
